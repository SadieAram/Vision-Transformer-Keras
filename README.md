# Vision Transformer (ViT) for Image Classification

## Overview

This repository implements a Vision Transformer (ViT) model for image classification using TensorFlow and Keras. The project is organized to provide a modular and structured approach to training, evaluating, and exploring the ViT model.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following structure:

- **notebooks:** Contains Jupyter Notebooks with code organized by functionality:
  - `data_processing`: Notebook for data preprocessing (`notebooks/data_processing/data_processing_notebook.ipynb`).
  - `model_training`: Notebook for training the Vision Transformer model (`notebooks/model_training/model_training_notebook.ipynb`).
  - `evaluation`: Notebook for model evaluation and analysis (`notebooks/evaluation/evaluation_notebook.ipynb`).
  
- **data:** Contains scripts and modules related to data processing (`data/data_processing_script.py`).
- **models:** Contains the implementation of the Vision Transformer model (`models/vit_model.py`).
- **tests:** Contains unit tests for the model (`tests/test_vit_model.py`).

- **.gitignore:** Specifies which files and directories to exclude from version control.
- **LICENSE:** The license file for the project.
- **README.md:** This file, providing an overview of the project.
- **requirements.txt:** Lists the dependencies required to run the code.
- **vit_script.py:** The main script for running the Vision Transformer model.
